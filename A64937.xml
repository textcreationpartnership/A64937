         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:61921:3"/>neither had they the leaſt inteligence of his Approch, by reſaon whereof he found but ſmall oppoſition, vntill the Lord Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts who did not lye far off came with with his men. At the approch of the Lord Roberts with his men, Prince Rupert had allmoſt gotten the Bridg, but was ſtayed by him, ſo that without the loſſe of any of his men he got in to the Towne.</p>
            <p>And planted himſelfe and his men upon the Edge of the Hils, and a bout twelf or one of the clocke in the after none who began to play afreſh vpon the Lord Roberts and his Forces, but their orduance did little or no execution which cauſed a great diſcontent in the Cavaleirs and made them ſwere that the Divill was in the powder there Bulets in their great cannon did not fly halfe way of there intended purpoſe ſo that before, that before they could reach the mark they aimed that their power and vigor was ſpent.</p>
            <p>When Prince <hi>Rubert</hi> had played thus
<pb facs="tcp:61921:3"/>ſome certain time but to ſmall purpoſe our men who all this while had bin almoſt idle, the greateſt part of their amunition being behind, were now encoraged with new ſuply of men and amunition, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they before had ſuſtained ſom ſmal loſſe, yet they were not thereby diſmaide, but made good afterwards for that they had ſuffered before now Colonell Hampden and Collonell Hollis came in with theire forces and with them greate ſtore of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, of which before there was great nede on the Parliaments ſide.</p>
            <p>And now being ſo well provided for the Enimy, they went brauely on, and with undanted ſperit played with their great pieces vpon the Enemy, which peaces did brave execution and ſervice that in a ſmall ſpace there fell of the Cavaleirs avery geat number, but of the Parliaments ſide very few.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:61921:4"/>
            <p>The Cavaleirs perceiving their loſſe to be ſo great, and the loſſe on the <hi>Parliaments</hi> ſide to be ſo ſmall, upon Sunday Night at bout eleaven or twelve of the clocke did quit that place, and Prince <hi>Rubert</hi> with all his forces fell backe to <hi>Kingflon;</hi> which Towne by the treachery of the inhabitants was delivered up unto the Cavaleirs, and the townſmen have ſince pulled up the Bridge; ſo that all paſſage for purſuite af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them is hindred.</p>
            <p>And I cannot here paſſe by the inhuman and moſt barbarous actions of the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leirs at their entrance into <hi>Acton,</hi> amongſt the reſt one example being of a moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous nature, will render their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons odious unto you. When they entred the town firſt of all, and were ſeated therein, ſome of the Cavaleirs went up and downe to plunder where they had intelligence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtore of money, Plate, or jewels of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue were; amongſt the reſt it happened that they came unto one Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> his houſe, but he not being then who is a <hi>Brewer</hi> in
<pb facs="tcp:61921:4"/>the Towne of <hi>Acton,</hi> they comming to this Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> his houſe, did demaund the Mr. of the houſe, but he not being then within would not be content with that anſwer but fell to pillaging; Miſtris <hi>Peircy</hi> the <hi>Brewers</hi> wife, having not bin delivered of a child above one weeke before, was very much affrighted at the vnruly carriage of the Cavaliers, and although ſhe was weake yet thinking by faire perſwaſions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to appeaſe them for the preſent came down and deſired them that they would deſiſt from ſuch uncivill actions and that they ſhould have what they could deſire, or the houſe could ſupply them withall.</p>
            <p>Theſe her faire ſpeeches gave them but little or noe ſatiſfaction but the more ſhe intreated the more violent were they in the perſecution of their violent miſdeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, ſhee perſwads but they were ſtill as death as adders, and at the laſt one of them more cruell then the others, as ſhe was ſtanding by weeping did cock his piſtoll, and ſhot her with her child in

            <p>Upon Munday, after the Cavaliers had loſt <hi>Brainford,</hi> and ſheltred themſelves in <hi>Kingſton,</hi> after ſome time, ſome of them came over the water againe and tooke <hi>Sion-houſe,</hi> thinking by this meanes to ſtop all proviſion from comming unto the City, but they were much deceived, for the <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> who had liſted themſelves under the Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi> tooke two ſmall Piniſſes mand with fourteene peeces of Ordnance, and with them gave many a brave ſhot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the houſe, but could doe but little good by reaſon of the ſtrength of the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding could do ſmall execution.</p>
